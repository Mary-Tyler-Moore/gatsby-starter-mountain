Hello, I hope you’re having a wonderful day! On this blog, I talk a lot about personal, business and brand growth. I’m one of the Two Fly Guys, a media production company. Our services are divided into two main silos. One of those is videography for weddings, and the other end is focused on commercial videos. Our approach to videography in business is to offer non-canned, creative production with the aim of going viral. Videos like our rap video, “Grandmas Eat Sushi for the First Time” and our continuing You Got Served series are some of our bigger hits. It’s our mission to create compelling content that can take our clients to new heights!
