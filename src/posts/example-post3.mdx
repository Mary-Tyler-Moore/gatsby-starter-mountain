## THE HUSTLE, THE GRIND

What up ya’ll! People who know me know I’m all about the hustle. It is super important to me that I live up to my potential. I don’t think you can understate how helpful it is for personal growth to put your all into everything you do, even small tasks. Even dancing when you don’t know how to dance.

Let me say a few quick words about Ray, the Puerto Rican barber here in Statesboro. I always like speaking to him. I’m also really busy a lot of the times, so one time I said “Ray, when’re you gonna give me a haircut? How early can you do it?” And this man literally cut my hair at like 6 in the morning. There’s no reason he had to do that. He owed me nothing. But to me, that is something so rare and valuable. When someone shows me that they grind for their values and work, I respect it a lot, and I strive to be respected for it too.

I sometimes get asked if putting in 110% all the time gets stressful or exhausting. I think perspective and state of mind is huge in preventing that. Self-confidence leads to better results which leads to more self-confidence. People talk about burnout, but I don’t believe in burnout. It’s a crazy fast-paced way to live that requires sacrifice, but so rewarding.

Back to the grind!
