I owe so much of my success to my parents. Thanks to them, I understand work ethic, how to carry myself, and that nothing is impossible to achieve.

These are big shoes to fill. One thing that pushes me is that I donâ€™t want to live in their shadow for the rest of my life, so part of why I work so hard is to prove to people that I had my part in the overall success of the world.
