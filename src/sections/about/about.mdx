  <h2>DREAM BIG.THEN DREAM BIGGER.</h2>
  <p>
    I am a restaurateur and business-owner interested in entrepreneurship, innovation, and the hustle it takes to make your dreams come true. I work to make a positive and lasting impact on my community in ways that push my limits. Currently, I own the Statesboro restaurants The Boiling Shrimp, Soyumi Asian Kitchen and am co-founder of Two Fly Guys Media. I am all about identifying and pursuing new trends â€“ or better yet, setting them.

Want free business idea, to discuss an idea or to collaborate on a project? Let me hear you out!
